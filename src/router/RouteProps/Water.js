    <li>
      Know the different Maritime Salvage Laws, Rules, and Regulations specific to the recovery of submerged property in
      the different types of waters and waterways on and near Disc Golf courses.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ensure you fully understand whether a salvage includes partial or full vessel recovery.
    </li>
    <li>
      Salvage can encompass a wide meaning depending on the context, and care must be taken by salvors to ensure that 
      they adhere to certain rules such that they are entitled to rewards. 
    </li>
    <li>
      There are very specific conditions set to define the award and contractual payment awarded to the salvor. Considerations
      may include the success of the salvage, the potential danger faced by the salvor, valuation of the salvaged property,
      all the articles listed within the relevant sections of the 1989 Salvage Convention, and as of recent: whether a 
      reasonable effort was made to prevent environmental damanges.
    </li>
    <li>
      No Cure; No Pay is routinely enforced to prevent unlawful claims on rewards and other benefits.
    </li>
    <li>
      Many find the engagement of a salvor prevents the plundering of their property by unknown or unsavory operators.
    </li>
    <p>
    Maritime salvage is not restricted to a single generalized framework that governs all types of vessels and locations. 
    Instead, it is a broad umbrella term referring to the categories that it governs. There may be offshore salvages 
    involving bringing up property or a vessel itself from an offshore location. This refers to any open body of water not surrounded by coastline and extending beyond a nationâ€™s territorial waters. Here, the operating and environmental conditions are very harsh due to the unsheltered nature of the salvage.</p>

  <strong>It's probably best you just go back and follow the land route.</strong>
